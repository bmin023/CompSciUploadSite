# CPP Upload Site
My freshman Computer Science class at Baylor University has a custom upload site for its C++ course. I thought it would be fun to try and make my own version of it.
## Using the Site
For all my fellow classmates using this to test out their own code, I am trying to get it up as a site, but until then, there are a couple ways you can use this repo. First, inside public/assignments there are folders for each assignment that give you rescources and test cases so you can run your code in your own evnoirnment before running it against the actual site. Second, if you install `node`, you can download the code and run it with `npm run start` it will be available on `localhost:3000`
### Have fun.
